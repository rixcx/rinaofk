            <p>I had no prior experience with commonly used tools; VScode, GitHub, etc. To acquire these tools knowledge, I decided to use them in creating my own website. Additionally, I actively used properties and functions that I had not had the opportunity to use in my work.</p>

          <h3>What discovered</h3>
          <p>When I set up the environment, I made a conscious effort to grasp the purpose behind each step, rather than simply going through set up it. Moreover, by utilizing new tools on projects with a simple structure, I was able to understand their basic usage. The knowledge gained through creating this work has been used in the production of subsequent projects.</p>
